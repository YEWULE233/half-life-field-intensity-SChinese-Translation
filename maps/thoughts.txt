// "HAVE A SAFE DAY"

BRIEFING 我们成功潜入了设施，至今未发现异常情况.然而，有士兵报告看到一些怪事.简报内容……非常简短.发生了一起事故，我们必须控制局势，这包括消灭当地人员.

KEVINRADIOMAN 原来我的基友凯文是我们任务中的无线电员.他是我永远可以信赖的人.

HOUNDEYES 那些三条腿的奇怪生物是什么？也许是实验产物吧？真是搞不懂.

// HOSTILE TAKEOVER

BROKENELEVATOR 电梯坏了.弗朗西斯正在里面尝试修理，但谁知道需要多长时间.在此期间，我会从外面查看一下.幸运的是，那个舱门很容易打开.

HEADCRABS 这些像螃蟹一样的生物是什么？我开始对上级感到愤怒，他们在任务前没有告诉我们更多具体信息.但也许他们自己也并未完全了解当前形势.

TWOWOMEN 在那扇门关闭之前，我瞥见了两名女性.她们身穿某种防弹衣，并对军方持有敌意.但考虑到我们任务的本质，我无法评判她们.

CROSSFIRE 这简直疯狂.同一间屋子里出现了三方冲突：设施人员、那些狂野生物以及我们——海军陆战队.

ZOMBIES 我发现了乘坐另一部电梯的两名队员.他们的遭遇是任何人都不愿敌人遭受的命运.

POWERGENERATOR 气密门应该通往出口，但该区域电力中断.我必须找到恢复电力供应的方法

LOCKEDAIRLOCK 那扇讨厌的门关上了，再也打不开.我开始理解弗朗西斯对这些障碍物的厌恶之情.现在，我只能独自前行.

TERRIBLEPLACE What a terrible place. The radio doesn't work anymore and these monsters seem to wait around every other corner.

ALLYPERSONNEL Some of the facility staff don't know the true purpose of our mission. They believe the military is here to rescue them. That can actually come in handy, since now I'm cut off from the rest of the squad.

// HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT

ENEMYPERSONNEL Some of the facility staff still recognize me as an enemy. Need to keep that in mind.

CREATURES Did they create these creatures? Well, they were studying them for sure.

SIERRASQUAD I've located Squad Sierra. Or rather their remains to be precise.

GAMMAACCESS Now I can access the Gamma complex. I just need to make sure this scientist stays alive as long as required.

SATELLITE A satellite? A rocket launch? This facility has a space program on top of everything else?

HORNETGUN I've found one of those 'hivehands' used by the alien soldiers, detached from its owner. Should I use it as a weapon myself? At war everything becomes 'handy'. Hehe.

FREEMAN Kevin is very concerned about this Freeman guy. Must be a dangerous one. I hate not being in the loop about current developments. At least Kevin is well informed.

// ON THE TRACK

SQUADOSCAR Squad Oscar was wiped out by alien forces. I'm moving further ahead on my own.

KINGPIN What was that dreadful creature? That monster ripped the whole squad to shreds all by itself! I've managed to chase it away, but something tells me, we'll meet again.

// WEAK FORCE

NEWFORCE Those Black Ops forces... Are they gonna work with us? Can they be trusted?

ALIENSOIL Not only are alien creatures emerging from thin air, but now it looks like pieces of another world infiltrate the complex.

// RECOVERY

OLDLABPORTAL I stepped into the portal thing. The place was gonna blow up anyway, so I had no choice. I still can't comprehend what I experienced afterwards.. My head is cracking.

FLASHLIGHT My night-vision goggles broke down. Maybe I can find a flashlight somewhere.

SECURITYGUARD This security guard is aware of our mission, but is still willing to help if I don't hurt him. I'm not in any position to blindly obey the orders anyway.

GETTOSURFACE I need to get to the surface. From there I should be able to contact someone from H.E.C.U.

RECONNECTION I found a radio and reestablished contact with Kevin. But these noises at the end of his transmission... Not a good sign. I hope Kevin is alright.

// FIELD INTENSITY

HAPPYTOLEAVE This whole mission is pure chaos. I'd be happy to leave this god forsaken place right now.

EVACFAILED The evac failed. I'm on my own. Staying at the same spot is not gonna help me. Maybe I can find someone else to group up with.

// THE VERGE

XENPORTAL Not the first time I'm stepping into a portal. But this time I felt like something or someone is calling upon me from the other side. Maybe I'm just raving. This place looks like a dream. A bad one at that.

THEIRWORLD This is definitely not a dream. This world IS real, it's just not OUR world. It's THEIRS.

HALLUCINATING I'm starting to hear and see weird things. Is it a part of this world or is it just inside my head? I guess the fall didn't go so well for me after all.

BEYONDWORLD There are things beyond the real world. Even beyond THIS world. Or maybe this place keeps tricking me into thinking that.

// F.U.B.A.R.

BACKTOEARTH I'm back on Earth. Kevin managed to reach me over the radio. It's a relief to hear his voice again.

BLACKOPS The Black Ops clearly got their own agenda. They're not very friendly.

KEVINWEIRD Kevin sounded so detached. Why doesn't he disclose his location?

// DEATHMATCH

// DEDUCTION

TRUCKWAYOUT I can leave this place on the truck. I just need to gather some things. I don't have the keys and the truck is out of gas.

KEVINISDEAD As it turns out, Kevin is dead. I can't even say for how long my mind played these tricky games on me, making me believe that I heard his voice. I guess, anyone would go crazy in a situation like this... Now I just want to leave this place even more.
