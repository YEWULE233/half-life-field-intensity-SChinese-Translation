// "HAVE A SAFE DAY"

KV_RESPONDA kv 奥尔·德菲尔德下士，能收到吗？请回答.
KV_RESPONDB kv 罗密欧小队，请回答.

KV_HELLO kv 史蒂芬猜猜，谁是你的无线电操作员，耶，是我——你的老基友凯文.

KV_BRIEF kv 你的小队几乎到达了目的地了.根据我们的地图显示，去三层宿舍的电梯应该在附近.

TG_GATES hg 电梯肯定在这个门的后面.我的焊枪没有办法切开他...兄啊，我都恨死那些厚的大门了.
TG_PANEL hg 也许我们可以用... 文明点的方式去找到控制面板然后打开那个门？
TG_NVG   hg 好了... 只有你有夜视仪，你去吧.

TG_DOGS hg 我以前从未进过这种品种的狗.

KV_ELEVA kv 史蒂芬，进电梯.
KV_ELEVB kv 奥尔·德菲尔德，跟随你们小队工程师行动.

KV_ORDER kv 牢记命令，史蒂芬。不留活口.

// HOSTILE TAKEOVER

TG_BROKEN hg 靠，好像哪里坏了... 我恨死电梯了.
TG_ELEVA hg 也许可以从其他地方修好这东西。奥尔德菲尔德，从舱口出去探索一下下面.
TG_ELEVB hg 我会留下来，在这看看能不能修好，但你在外面可能会运气更好罢.

KV_FREEMAN kv 大家都在讨论这个戈登·弗里曼的家伙，看来他要为了这团糟负责。总部派小队搜查了他的宿舍.

FG_LADIES hg 净是些女朝巴（山东话）.

KV_RESTCREW kv 嘿，史蒂芬。自从你们其他人进入2号电梯后，我就再也没有收到他们的消息了。你见到他们吗?

TG_ZOMBIES hg 等等，这些东西...不可能.

KV_NEWOBJ kv 奥德菲尔德，给你个新任务。前往E区。这有可能是戈登·弗里曼所在的位置。给我捉活的，好带审问.
KV_THEYMAD kv 顺便说下，其他海军陆战队真恨不得扒了他的皮，我听说他K了我们很多人...小心点，老兄.

TG_POWER hg 妈了个巴子，这地方没电了。这里应该有两台发电机来着...我讨厌发电机.

TG_STUCK hg 什么...鬼，这该死的门。下士，你自己先去吧。我好像要被困在这里很久了.

// HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT

KV_HEARME kv Stefan? Do you read me?
KV_CONNECT kv Finally! This connection's been giving me hell for a while now. I see you reached the Bio-lab.
KV_SECTORE kv Well, bad news, Gordon Freeman's on the other end of Sector E, nowhere near you.
KV_OTHERSCI kv But there might be other scientists in this area for you to track down.

KV_SIERRA kv Squad Sierra should be somewhere in Bio-Labs, but I've lost contact with them. I'm afraid you're on your own, buddy.

SC_BIOHELLO sc At last, a fellow human! I guess you want to get out of the lab. The shortest way to the surface from here is through the Gamma complex. If you lead me to its entrance I can let you in.
SC_BIOGARG sc Unfortunately, I can't get past that Gargantua in the next room.
SC_BIOUNLOCK sc My control over the system is limited, but I can open the entrance back down in the corridor.

SC_BIOTEST sc Testing, testing. I hope you can hear me.
SC_BIOPLAN sc I know how to deal with an unwanted guest. Grab some explosive alien bugs. You can use them to kill the damned creature.

SC_BIOLETSGO sc Oh, you defeated the beast! Excellent. Thank you for the help. Now we can head to the Gamma complex.

SC_BIOGAMMA sc The entrance to the Gamma complex is at the end of this hallway. Let's go.
SC_DETOUR sc Well, we'll have to take a detour here.

SC_SATELLITE sc Right before you rescued me from my confinement I received a transmission from my Lambda colleagues. They said they need to get the Alpha satellite in orbit.
SC_MILITARY sc They also tried to say something about you, military forces. Sadly the connection was broken. I presume the Lambda team just wanted you to help them with the rocket launch.

KV_SATELLITE kv That's actually an interesting piece of information, regarding the satellite.
KV_ROCKET kv The brass isn't going to be happy with rockets going off during their operation. I've forwarded them the message.

KV_HEVSUIT kv These must be the same suits as the one that Gordon Freeman wears.
KV_EXAMINEHEV kv Get a look at one of those suits, Stefan.
KV_CHECKHEV kv Oldfield, check out that hazard suit.
KV_HEVTRACK kv Looks like those suits have tracking devices on them. Assuming Gordon's does too, we should be able to track his movement through the facility.

KV_NOVEMBER kv Squad November is right above your current location. Join them in their search for Freeman.

// ON THE TRACK

KV_ONTHETRACK kv Thanks to your investigation of the hazard suit, we're now on track to catch Freeman.

FG_NOVHELLO hg Corporal Oldfield, it's good to see you. Oscar Squad was supposed to help us to push through this mess but it looks they've gotten into trouble. The enemy is coming in great numbers.
FG_NOVFREEMAN hg All I want is to get my hands around Freeman's throat, but we're stuck here having to fight these aliens instead.

FG_NOVNOWAYA hg Looks like all passages are locked down. Oscar Squad was supposed to open them from the other side, yet we haven't heard anything from them in a while.
FG_NOVNOWAYB hg We need to find a way around.

KV_BARNEY kv It appears Freeman is not the only pain in our butts. Some security guard rescued one of the important scientists we captured before.

KV_NOVATTACKED kv Squad November is under heavy attack, Stefan. Find a way to get back there.

KV_LIMAISNEAR kv Stefan, you're close to the location of the Lima squad. They need your help. Apparently the aliens have got air support.

KV_ROSENBERG kv Attention, Squad Lima. Head to the old lab sector. This is where Dr. Rosenberg and his team are hiding.

KV_MANTARAYS kv Manta rays. That's what we call them.
KV_ANTIAIR kv We're not even sure if they're animals or machines. But they pose a real threat. Hopefully our anti-air forces will find a way to deal with them.

// WEAK FORCE

KV_BLACKOPS kv These are not our units. Someone requested reinforcements from Black Operations. I don't have a clue what their assignment is.
KV_OBJECTIVES kv Let's focus on our objectives. We still need to catch that Freeman guy or at least Rosenberg and his team.

KV_SETUPTRAP kv Squad Whiskey-Tango is about to set up a trap for Rosenberg and his crew. Your assistance is requested, Stefan. You can get to the old labs through the ventilation system.

// RECOVERY

SC_WOKEN sc Oh, you've woken up. I'm glad to see my life saving efforts weren't in vain.
SC_SITUATION sc I was hoping that you soldiers had come to rescue us, but now it seems we are all in the same situation.
SC_NOWEAPONS sc Sadly we don't have any weapons to provide you with firepower, yet we still have something to offer.
SC_MEDKIT sc This is the portable medkit device developed within the walls of this lab. It allows you to heal your own wounds as well as your allies.
SC_GOODLUCK sc I hope you have better luck out there, or I fear none of us will get through this alive.

BA_YOUNEEDME ba Hello, soldier. I'm aware of the military plans of 'containment'. But you can't proceed without my help.
BA_DOORACCESS ba Don't hurt me. My access code should unlock any door around this area.

KV_SQUADALPHA kv Squad Alpha, do you read me?
KV_LUCKY kv Stefan, is that you? I thought the explosion in the prototype labs turned you into dust! But here you are, lucky bastard.
KV_EVAC kv Listen, things got really messy in your absence. We've been ordered to evacuate the facility. Join Team Bravo on their way to the extraction point.
KV_CATCHUP kv I'll catch up with you later. Don't wait for me, fly away as soon as you get a chance.
KV_WHATISTHIS kv What the hell?.. Um, guys?

// FIELD INTENSITY

FG_HEADEVAC hg Stefan? Where the hell have you been? The brass has ordered us to pull out. We must head to the evac center.

GG_KEEPSEYE gg No worries! Sergeant Greg is keeping an eye on you.
GG_BLOWGATES gg Stay away from the underground entrance. I'm gonna blow up the doors.

GG_CANTBELIEVE gg Man, I can't believe I actually shot this thing down!
GG_OHCRAP gg Holy crap! What is this shit?

// F.U.B.A.R.

KV_RETURN kv Stefan? It's Kevin. I thought you were lost in action... So, I guess the whole evac plan failed. I did not make it either.
KV_REUNITE kv I wish we could reunite, but I'm sorta cut off right now. We'll talk again later, buddy.

KV_RADIO kv Stefan, do you remember our military communication trainings? You were so clumsy at using the radio set. But eventually you got it right, under my strict guidance.
KV_CONTACT kv I'm just saying, I can still find you, I can still contact you. That's a good thing.

// DEATHMATCH

KV_DEATH kv Even though we were trained to contain hazardous situations, nothing can prepare you for what's happening here. Here death itself assumes shapes unseen before.

SC_COMMONENEMY sc A soldier! I don't know if I can trust you, but at least we have a common enemy, so we might be useful to each other.
SC_BOTHWORK sc Since we both want to get out of here, we should work together.
SC_LOCKEDGATES sc The main gates are locked but I can open them, if I can get to the control panel.
SC_DANGERFIRE sc This way looks dangerous. Thank God, my suit is heat-resistant.
SC_GETAROUND sc The control room is right around the corner. I'll go there, while you go back and find a way around this mess.
SC_KEEPGOING sc Glad to see you're OK. We can keep going.
SC_DANGERGAS sc These pipes pose no danger to my suit. I just hope nothing bad happens to me till we meet again.
SC_WORRY sc I've started to worry. Mostly about myself.
SC_DEVICE sc I would not let any soldier put their hands on this device in any normal circumstance. But the current situation is far from normal.
SC_DISPLACER sc The displacer allows the user to travel between the borderworld and back again. But more notably, it can also be used as a weapon.
SC_DANGERRAD sc My suit is designed to protect against high radiation levels. I will open the gates for you.

// DEDUCTION

KV_DARKNESS kv Stefan... I find myself trapped in the dark corner. Seeing things in their true form is getting harder. What about you, buddy? We should keep it tight till the end.

KV_DOORWAY kv You're getting closer. I'm getting closer. There's a one-sided doorway between you and I. Whatever you do, don't step into it.

KV_HEREIAM kv Hey, Stefan. It's me, Kevin. Here I am on the ground. Lying motionless, breathless, lifeless... I know it's hard to comprehend, but it's the truth, and you'll have to accept it.
KV_ACCOMPANY kv I guess I just wanted to accompany you a little bit longer. Or, well, you wanted to be accompanied by me.
KV_KEYS kv Anyways, take these keys. That truck is your only hope of getting out of here. As for me... I'm staying. I can't help you anymore. Try to get home safe. Goodbye, my friend.
